# Math-for-Computer-Science
Math implemention content for educational purpose, all implemented in Python.

## Matrix creation and operations like add, substract, multiply are implemented
Since I have another repository about algorithms, result from I do not like redundant functional, rest math implementions are in that directory

(code concern math will be implemented by both Java and Python)
